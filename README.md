# Password Generator
An application that generates a unique password based on user's specifications

## Description
This application asks user for password length and types of characters and spits out a random string that contains at least one of each of the specified characters.
<br>
Initially, I was working with strings and .charAt methods to pick random characters, but I decided to switch to arrays because I was able to wrap my head around it a little better.
